As 2025 came to an end, our community closed the year with a milestone that reflects the power of collaboration and shared learning.  
We formed a focused study group for the **GitHub Copilot certification**, bringing together more than 14 participants who committed to preparing seriously and consistently.

## How the Study Group Worked

The group was intentionally designed around collaboration rather than individual effort. Over the course of the preparation period, we:

- Ran regular group study sessions focused on core exam topics.
- Held joint discussions and Q&A to clarify concepts and share different perspectives.
- Organized community-led sessions where members who were one step ahead, or had more hands-on experience, explained concepts and real-world scenarios to the rest of the group.
- Encouraged everyone to apply GitHub Copilot to real projects, not just sample exercises, so the learning stayed practical and relevant.

This structure created a supportive environment where participants could learn from each other, stay accountable, and move at a consistent pace.

## The Result: A Shared Achievement

The group sat the exam in roughly the same time frame, and a significant number of participants successfully achieved the **GitHub Copilot certification**.

Beyond the positive results, this experience demonstrated how:

- Peer support makes complex topics easier to approach.
- Shared accountability helps people stay committed over several weeks.
- Community-led explanations often make abstract concepts more concrete and relatable.

For us, this was not just about passing an exam. It was about proving that structured, community-driven learning can accelerate growth in emerging areas like AI-assisted development.

Some participants chose to share their certifications publicly, while others preferred to keep them private. Both choices are equally respected. What matters most is the learning, the skills gained, and the progress each person made.

## What Comes Next

Building on this experience, we are now preparing a series of **open sessions** to share:

- How we organized and ran the study group.
- How we used GitHub Copilot in real-world scenarios.
- The materials, practices, and patterns that proved most helpful for exam readiness.
- Lessons learned that can help other communities replicate or adapt this approach.

Our goal is to make this experience reusable: to turn one community success story into a model that others can adopt, extend, and improve.

**Thank you** to everyone who participated, contributed content, led sessions, asked questions, or simply showed up consistently. This achievement is the result of a community effort, and we are looking forward to building on this momentum in 2026 and beyond.
